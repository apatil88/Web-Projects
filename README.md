#Petcare Services
Developed a fictitious Responsive Single-Page website using Bootstrap3 framework. Utilized Bootstrap's layout classes, like containers, rows, and columns, and customized Bootstrap's CSS. Addressed layout challenges like multiple grids and columns. Also, tracked navigation as users scroll, with the ScrollSpy plugin, and created a full-screen, responsive image carousel.
